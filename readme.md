<h1>Personal Portfolio Website V2.0</h1>


<p>I intially began to build this website as part of the Front-End Web developments course at freecodecamp.com,
and now it has become the front page to display my web projects.The purpose of this repository is to make code to my personal portfolio website freely available to all
to learn from and critique me on. This is a simplistic website that implements a lot of modern tools
used in contemporary web development. One of my first web projects that taught me a lot about maintaining
and hosting a website. It also contains links to examples of my other web projects.
