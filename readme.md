<h1>Personal Portfolio Website V2.0</h1>


<p>I initially began to build this website as part of the Front-End Web developments course at freecodecamp.com,
and now it has become the front page to display my web projects. The purpose of this repository is to make code
to my personal portfolio website freely available to all to learn from and critique me on.
This project is a simplistic website that implements a lot of modern tools used in contemporary web development.
This project is not a tutorial but rather simple examples on how to implement these tools. One of my first web projects that taught me
a lot about maintaining and hosting a website. It also contains links to examples of my other web projects.
</p>

<h2>Website Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><h4>Responsive Front-End Using Bootstrap and Jquery</h4></li>
<li><h4>Javascript implementation of smooth scrolling on NavBar</h4></li>
<li><h4>Form creation and submission using ajax.</h4></li>
<li><h4>Implementation of Node.js</h4></li>
<li><h4>Using Express.js server hosting and file serving</h4></li>
<li><h4>Form handling through Express.js</h4></li>
<li><h4>Static file creation in Node.js</h4></li>
</ul>


<h2>Tools</h2>

<h3>Front-End</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</h4></li>
    <p>They almost go without saying, but there were several
    alternatives to building the Front-End offered through node.js</p>
<li><h4>twitter Bootstrap</h4></li>
    <p>Used to provide a slick responsive design.<br>
    A simple implementation of bootstrap's grid system.</p>
<li><h4>Jquery</h4></li>
    <p>A dependency for Bootstrap, and an all around<br>
    great tool to create some responsive javascript, and
    easily manipulate the DOM.</p>
</ul>


<h3>Back-End</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>Node.js</h4></li>
    <p>Node.js has been one of the simplistic but powerful<br>
    server-end tools that I have ever used. I loved how I could use<br>
    Javascript, which was great coming fresh off Front-End web development.</p>
<li><h4>Express.js</h4></li>
    <p>This package offered by npm allows for a simplistic approach<br>
    to creating a web servers that serve static files.</p>
<li><h4>Apache HTTP Server</h4></li>
    <p>I host the website on an apache server. At first I had problems<br>
    configuring it, but after a bit of googling I figured out the configurations<br>
    (I will post those at a later date for the benefit of anybody in the struggle.</p>
</ul>


<h2>Web Projects</h2>

<p>I have several web projects I've posted on my portfolio that are a testament to my growth
as a web developer. Many of these projects I started building when I was working towards my
Front-End web developer certificate at www.freecodecamp.com. Itâ€™s a great website for
aspiring web developers to learn for free, and I recommend it to anyone looking to gain
skills in web design or development.</p>
